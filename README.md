# AethricCrawler

A simple python script that runs through https://playorna.com/ and collects the entries of spells in multiple languages, with the purpose of improving translations of the game.

The code is based on and gratefully adapted from github.com/mCodingLLC/VideosSampleCode/blob/master/videos/117_hello_async/crawl.py
Thank you for the great tutorials!
